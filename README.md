# Solder---CarPCB
My PCB is in the shape of a formula 1 racing car. Its main purpose it to either move forward or backward. It had multiple transistors to act like a logic gate to control the direction of the motors. There are two buttons on the top. One button makes the motors spin clockwise (and the car go forward) and turns on the LEDs on the front. The other button makes the motrs spin in the opposite direction (car goes backward) and makes the back LEDs turn on. The buttons act as a toggle, so the first click turns on the motor, and pressing it again turns it off. 
Bill of Materials: 
Battery pin (i have my own battery, since it requires 5v or more) x1
DC motors (I have my own) x2
10u capacitors x2
LED x4
PNP transistor x2
NPN transistor x 8
Resistors x20
Push button x2
